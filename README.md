# The Problem Oswald Solves

## The Problem It Solves

Modern development pipelines lack a seamless way to:

- **Store codebases securely on-chain** to ensure immutability and transparency.
- **Audit and validate smart contracts** collaboratively and efficiently during the CI/CD process.
- **Streamline deployment of smart contracts** to EVM-compatible chains with built-in safety checks.

## How It Helps

- **Secure On-Chain Storage:** Safeguard your codebase or files with decentralized storage, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof history.
- **Automated Audits:** Enable multiple agents to audit smart contracts in your CI/CD pipeline, reaching a consensus before approval.
- **Safe & Hassle-Free Deployment:** Simplify the process of deploying validated contracts to EVM chains with just a click.

This tool enhances security, reliability, and efficiency for developers, making Web3 integration in DevOps workflows easier than ever.
